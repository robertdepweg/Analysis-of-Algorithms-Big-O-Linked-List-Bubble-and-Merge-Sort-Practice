# In-Class 4 - Analysis of Algorithms, Big O, Linked List, Bubble, and Merge Sort

## Author



## Description

The purpose of this in-class is to learn about the analysis of algorithms,
big o notation, linked lists, and sorting algorithms like merge sort.

We will focus on the following:

Demonstrate how to create a linked list with various methods that can be used
on it. We will talk about which parts of a linked list are needed for stacks
and queues. We will compare the time and space complexity of doing various
operations with a linked list vs a traditional array (list). We will also
explore some sorting algorithms and the strengths and weakness of them.
